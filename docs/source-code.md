Source Code
===========

You should always find the newest unburden-home-dir source code via
git at either

* [GitHub](https://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir), or
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/unburden-home-dir/unburden-home-dir).

GitHub is used as primary hub, GitLab is updated in most cases
automatically, too.

The copy at

* the [Git Repository at D-PHYS](http://git.phys.ethz.ch/?p=unburden-home-dir.git)

is updated less often and the copy at

* [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/unburden-home-dir/unburden-home-dir.git/)

is just a frozen archive at the state when it
[has been shut down in June 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/).
