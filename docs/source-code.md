Source Code
===========

You should always find the newest unburden-home-dir source code via
git at either

* [GitHub](http://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir),
* the [Git Repository at D-PHYS](http://git.phys.ethz.ch/?p=unburden-home-dir.git),
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/unburden-home-dir/unburden-home-dir), or
* [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/unburden-home-dir/) (deprecated).

GitHub is used as primary hub, git.phys.ethz.ch is usually up-to-date,
too, Gitlab and Gitorious
([will be shut down in June 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/))
gets pushed less often, but should get all major updates in time, too.
