Source Code
===========

You should always find the newest unburden-home-dir source code via
git at either

* [GitHub](https://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir), or
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/unburden-home-dir/unburden-home-dir).

GitHub is used as primary hub, GitLab is updated in most cases
automatically, too.

The copies at

* [at D-PHYS](http://git.phys.ethz.ch/?p=unburden-home-dir.git), and
* [at Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/unburden-home-dir/unburden-home-dir.git/)

are no more updated, should no more be used and may vanish completely
in the future.
