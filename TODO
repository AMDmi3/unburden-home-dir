Add warnings if either $HOME or $TARGET do not begin with a
slash. This can cause broken symlinks but may also break the test
suite. :-)

Idea from Pietro Abate: Excludes for wildcards, like "all from
.cache/* except .cache/duplicity".

Honor $XDG_ variables for unburden-home-dir's own configuration files
(at least optional), but possibly also in unburden-home-dir.list for
alternative locations of .cache and friends.
