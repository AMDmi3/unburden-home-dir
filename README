This project mainly consists of an Xsession.d entry to automatically
move given files and directories off the home directory and replace
them with symbolic links.

See http://wiki.phys.ethz.ch/readme/application_cache_files for the
reasoning behind this project.

You should always find the newest code via git at either
http://git.phys.ethz.ch/?p=unburden_home_dir.git (primary site) or
http://github.com/xtaran/unburden_home_dir (mirror, or in case you
prefer to use social forking :-).

An example unburden_home_dir_list file looks like this:

d .cache cache
f .config/google-chrome/*/Thumbnails google-chrome-thumbnails-%1
d .mozilla/firefox/*/Cache firefox-cache-%1
d .thunderbird/*/Cache thunderbird-cache-%1
d .mozilla-thunderbird/*/Cache debian-thunderbird-cache-%1
d .conkeror.mozdev.org/conkeror/*/Cache conkeror-cache-%1
d .kazehakase/mozilla/kazehakase/Cache kazehakase-cache
d .opera/cache opera-cache
d .opera/opcache opera-opcache
d .thumbnails thumbnails
f .xsession-errors xsession-errors
# Merging two directories into one may still cause problems. Avoid it for now
d .Trash trash
d .local/Trash trash

First column: Type (directory or file)
Second column: Path relative to $HOME to move off to some other location
Third column: identifier for file or directory in the other location

File format still subject to change.
