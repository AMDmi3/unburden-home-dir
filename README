This project mainly consists of an Xsession.d entry to automatically
move given files and directories off the home directory and replace
them with symbolic links.

See http://wiki.phys.ethz.ch/readme/application_cache_files for the
reasoning behind this project.

You should always find the newest code via git at either
http://git.phys.ethz.ch/?p=unburden_home_dir.git (primary site) or
http://github.com/xtaran/unburden_home_dir (mirror, or in case you
prefer to use social forking :-).

See etc/ (or /usr/share/doc/unburden-home-dir/examples/ on debianoid
installations) for example files.

Explanation of the unburden_home_dir_list file format:

1st column: Action ("d, "r", or "m": delete/remove or move)
2nd column: Type ("d", "D", "f" or "F": directory or file, capital
	    letter means "create it if it doesn't exist")
3rd column: Path relative to $HOME to move off to some other location
4th column: identifier for file or directory in the other location

File format still subject to change.
