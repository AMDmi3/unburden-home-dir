unburden-home-dir (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make test suite check if lsof is available or not and expect different
    output in both cases. (Closes: #678780)
  * Use which('lsof') from File::Which instead of `which lsof`
    + Add dependency and build-dependency on libfile-which-perl
  * Use a copy of README.md named just README to be installed in the
    Debian binary package to avoid any associations with Linux' software
    RAID. (Closes: #678630)
  * Minor refactoring of t/undo.t for not confusing syntax highlighting

unburden-home-dir (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * If lsof is available, check if files to (re)move are still in use
    before (re)moving them.
    - Recommend lsof
  * Some Refactoring:
    - use Modern::Perl; add libmodern-perl-perl as dependencies.

    - replace last use of @_[...]
    - add missing trailing semicolons and explicit returns
    - remove all subroutine calls with "&" sigil

    - use lc($var) eq 'c' instead of two string comparisons

  * More documentation in README:
    - Add some paragraphs about reversing unburden-home-dir's effect
      (Closes: #673909)
    - Add sections How To and Common Issues + Troubleshooting
    - Reorder sections and add subsections to get a nice outline
  * Renamed README to README.md so it will be parsed as Markdown on GitHub
  * Added THANKS file
  * Add ~/.aptitude/cache to unburden-home-dir.list. (cf. #671780)
  * Fix typo in README.Debian (Closes: #673912; Thanks Touko Korpela!)

    be parsed
  * Suggest a find command in the README to find most caches in a home
    directory
