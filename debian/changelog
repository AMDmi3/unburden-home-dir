unburden-home-dir (0.0.20110203) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix bug when moving stuff and the target directory already exists. Use
    File::Rsync for that and add proper dependency to libfile-rsync-perl
    for that.
  * Fix bug where only the parent of an empty target directory has been
    created.
  * Reduce probability of false positives when looking for issues in the
    logs.
  * Add two more common cases to the example configuration:
    .conkeror[...]/Cache.Trash and .mozilla/default/[...]/Cache
