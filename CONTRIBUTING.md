Contributing to unburden-home-dir
=================================

Pull requests for bug fixes or features are very welcome, but please
keep in mind:

* All dependencies and build-dependencies should be available at least
  in Debian Unstable, preferably also in Debian Stable. (I know, the
  latter is currently not the case for `libstring-expand-perl`, but
  it's easy to backport.)

* If you contribute bigger patches which validate you own copyright,
  please use "GPLv2 or newer" as license.

or [via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir).
